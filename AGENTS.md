## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. PLAN.md Default

- Use PLAN.md for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use PLAN.md for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs to SPECS.md upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy to keep main context window clean

- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update 'tasks/lessons.md' with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness. (Note: These tests are for you to verify that the functionality you wrote works. The actual tests that you implement in the project should be minimal. The priority is business logic.)

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests -> then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to 'tasks/todo.md' with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review to 'tasks/todo.md'
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update 'tasks/lessons.md' after corrections

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI** (Python) — API server, business logic, background jobs
- **Supabase** (via CLI) — Postgres database, Auth, Realtime subscriptions, Storage

### Frontend
- **React** + **TypeScript** — SPA with component-based architecture
- Interactive map via **MapLibre GL** (open-source, no API key needed)

### Tooling
- Supabase CLI for local dev, migrations, and type generation
- FastAPI with `alembic` for any migration needs outside Supabase
- `pnpm` for frontend package management

### Architecture
- FastAPI serves REST API; frontend talks to FastAPI (not Supabase directly)
- Supabase Auth used via FastAPI middleware (frontend gets JWT, sends to API)
- Supabase Realtime for push notifications (websocket subscriptions)
- Map tiles: OpenStreetMap + MapLibre GL JS

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
